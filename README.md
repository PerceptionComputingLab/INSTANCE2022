## üèä‚ÄçAbout

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a common stroke type and has the highest mortality rate among all stroke types[1]. Early and accurate diagnosis of the ICH is critical for saving patients' lives. In regular clinical practice, Non-Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) is the most widely used modality for diagnosing ICH due to its fast acquisition and availability in most emergency departments [2]. In clinical diagnosis procedures, accurately estimating the volume of intracranial hemorrhage is significant for predicting hematoma progression and early mortality [3]. The hematoma volume can be estimated by manually delineating the ICH region by radiologists, which is time-consuming  and suffers from inter-rater variability . The ABC/2 method [4] is widely adopted in clinical practice to estimate hemorrhage volume for its ease of use. However, the ABC/2 method shows significant volume estimation error, especially for those hemorrhages with irregular shapes. Hence, it is necessary to establish a fully-automated segmentation method, which allows accurate and rapid volume quantification of the intracranial hemorrhage. However, it is still challenging to accurately segment the ICH for automatic methods because ICH exhibits large variations in shapes and locations, and has blurred boundarie.

Therefore, it is significant to propose a challenge to advance the novel automatic segmentation methods for accurate intracranial hemorrhage segmentations on NCCT images. However, there are no such challenges available right now. Thus, we intend to host the first Intracranial Hemorrhage Segmentation Challenge on Noncontrast head CT (Named INSTANCE 2022), which will be served as a solid benchmark for Intracranial hemorrhage Segmentation tasks.

Specifically, we have collected 200 3D volumes with refined labeling from 10 experienced radiologists, 100 for the training dataset, 70 for the closed testing dataset, and 30 for the opened validated dataset. DSC, HD, RVD are adopted as evaluation metrics for segmentation. This challenge will also promote intracranial hemorrhage treatment, interactions between researchers, and interdisciplinary communication.
